  <h1> How does blood type inheritance work?</h1>
  <p> Blood types are determined by a special type of inheritance called <u> codominance </u>. Everybody inherits two different <u> alleles </u>, or forms of a gene, from each parent to make up your <u> genotype </u>, or genetic makeup. Alleles can either be <u>dominant </u> or <u> recessive</u>. If you inherit a dominant allele for a trait, that dominant allele will control how you display that trait. In order to display the recessive trait, both alleles in your genotype have to be the recessive allele. </p>
    <p> A, B, and O are all different types of alleles for blood types. A and B are codominant, meaning that both are dominant forms of an allele. Therefore, if you inherit both an A allele and B allele, you will have an AB blood type. O is recessive. If you inherit two O alleles, then you will display an O blood type. If you inherit an A and an O, then your blood type would be A, and if you inherit a B and an O, then your blood type would be B.</p>
    <p> Blood types also have another component to them, called the <u> rhesus factor </u>, also known as the Rh factor. The Rh factor is a protein that can be found on red blood cells. If you have this protein, then your Rh factor would be positive. If you don't, it would be negative (an A+ blood type would have the protein and an A- would not). A positive Rh factor is dominant, therefore if you inherit a positive from either parent, you would have a positive Rh factor. You can only have a negative Rh factor if you inherit negative alleles from both of your parents.</p>
